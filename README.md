Installation
------------

CinnamonGestures is made of two distinct parts, a daemon (*gestured*) and a Cinnamon extension.

gestured can be installed as a [debian package](https://github.com/aodenis/CinnamonGestures/releases) or be built. Its purpose is to send libinput's events into DBus system bus, allowing the extension to receive it. It is automatically started by the extension and stops by itself.

The extension is a directory (*gestures@aodenis*) that must be installed in Cinnamon. Once done, you have to activate the extension in Cinnamon (Settings > Extensions).

```
git clone https://github.com/aodenis/CinnamonGestures
cd CinnamonGestures
sudo cinnamon-install-spice extension gestures@aodenis
```

How to use
----------

Slide three fingers up on your trackpad to display all windows, slide back down to go back to your desktop.
Slide four fingers up on your trackpad to display all workspaces, slide back down to go back to your desktop.
In both modes, click a window to activate it.
In window view, click a window with three fingers to close it.
In workspace view, click a workspace with three fingers to close it.
Slide four fingers right and left to switch between workspaces. Slide far enough on the right of a non-empty workspace to create a new one.
Slide three fingers down to minimize current window.

Unfinished feature
------------------

You may find settings in Cinnamon's extensions menu and enable there switching between windows by sliding three fingers left and right, an unfinished feature.

Known Bug
---------

This extension sometimes hangs and use 100% CPU. This bug _should_ be fixed, for the fourth time. In this case, restarting Cinnamon is a good way out.

Roadmap
-------

A proper documentation for this extension will come in the next few days. Then :
+ A button to create new workspaces in workspace overview
+ Possibility to drag windows to other workspaces
+ Four fingers down to show the desktop
+ Finish three finger window switching
+ Support for multiple display
+ Window titles
+ Many glitches and bugs to fix
