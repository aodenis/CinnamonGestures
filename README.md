+ Slide four fingers up on your trackpad to display all workspaces, slide back down to go back to your desktop.
+ In both modes, click a window to activate it.
+ In window view, click a window with three fingers to close it.

You may find settings in Cinnamon's extensions menu and enable there switching between windows by sliding three fingers left and right, an unfinished feature.
